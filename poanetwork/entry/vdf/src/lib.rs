//! # Rust implementations of class groups and verifyable delay functions
//!
//! This repo includes three crates
//!
//! * `classgroup`, which includes a class group implementation, as well as a
//!   trait for class groups.
//! * `vdf`, which includes a Verifyable Delay Function (VDF) trait, as well as
//!   an implementation of that trait.
//! * `vdf-cli`, which includes a command-line interface to the `vdf` crate.  It
//!   also includes additional commands, which are deprecated and will later be
//!   replaced by a CLI to the `classgroup` crate.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! First, install Rust, Cargo, and the GNU Multiprecision Library (GMP).  Then,
//! follow one of the below steps.
//!
//! ### To use the command line interface
//!
//! ```sh
//! $ git clone https://github.com/poanetwork/vdf
//! $ cd vdf
//! $ cargo install
//! $ vdf-cli aa 100
//! 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
//! $ vdf-cli aa 100 005271e8f9ab2eb8a2906e851dfcb5542e4173f016b85e29d481a108dc82ed3b3f97937b7aa824801138d1771dea8dae2f6397e76a80613afda30f2c30a34b040baaafe76d5707d68689193e5d211833b372a6a4591abb88e2e7f2f5a5ec818b5707b86b8b2c495ca1581c179168509e3593f9a16879620a4dc4e907df452e8dd0ffc4f199825f54ec70472cc061f22eb54c48d6aa5af3ea375a392ac77294e2d955dde1d102ae2ace494293492d31cff21944a8bcb4608993065c9a00292e8d3f4604e7465b4eeefb494f5bea102db343bb61c5a15c7bdf288206885c130fa1f2d86bf5e4634fdc4216bc16ef7dac970b0ee46d69416f9a9acee651d158ac64915b
